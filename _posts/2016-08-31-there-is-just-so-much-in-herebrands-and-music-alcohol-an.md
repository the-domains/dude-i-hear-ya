  There is just SO MUCH IN HERE...brands and music, Alcohol and music consumers,
  live events, appropriately aged audience willing to try new things,
  established alcohol brands trying to break out of the old patterns....it goes

  stewards here could easily be the content aggregators new and old.  Radio,
  streaming, podcasting.  It's all there if we want to do the work.

  This is a great view to the future for audio distribution channels...Echo,
  Amazon, Sonos.  Who will have the data necessary to target audio ads or
  sponsorships, native integrations, etc?  Seems like a win for the "device" vs

  Several months ago, Sonos revealed plans to bring voice control to its popular
  home audio speakers. Today at an event in New York City, the company shared
  more on its approach to letting users play music by speaking commands aloud
  instead of controlling everything by thumbing through the Sonos app.

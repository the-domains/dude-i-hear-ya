  New legislation proposed today seeks to clear up the debate in Chicago over
  whether rock, rap, and electronic music count as "music" when it comes to tax
  laws. Cook County, the municipality that includes Chicago, has been seeking
  about $200,000 apiece in back taxes from two small venues in the city, Evil
  Olive and Beauty Bar.
